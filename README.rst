===================
``BrainPy-Models`` is a repository accompany with `BrainPy <https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy>`_, which is a framework for spiking neural network simulation. With BrainPy, we implements the most cononical and effective neuron models and synapse models, and show them in ``BrainPy-Models``.
