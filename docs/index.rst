BrainPy-Models documentation
===============================

``BrainPy-Models`` is based on `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ neuronal
dynamics simulation framework. Here you can find the list of all the models implemented with
BrainPy for neurons, synapses and topological networks.



.. note::

   We welcome your implementation about `neurons`, `synapses`, `learning rules`,
   `networks` and `paper examples`. https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy-Models

The documentation includes three parts.

In `Tutorials` section, you can learn implementations of classical neuron 
models, synapse models and learning rules. With ``BrainPy``, our goal is to 
reveal the world of computational neuroscience to new learners.

In `Examples` section, we provide implentations of widely known and used 
networks (ex. Excitatort-inhibitory balanced network). We hope users can see 
these as examples of using `bpmodels` to simplify network implementation.

In `APIs` section, we give details about all the models that we provided and how
to use them with our API.
