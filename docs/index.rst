BrainPy-Models documentation
===============================

``BrainPy-Models`` is based on `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ neuronal
dynamics simulation framework. Here you can find the list of all the models implemented in
BrainPy for neurons, synapses and topological networks.



.. note::

   We welcome your implementation about `neurons`, `synapses`, `learning rules`,
   `networks` and `paper examples`. https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy-Models


Tutorials
=================
In this section, you can learn classical neuron models, synapse models and implementations of learning rules. With ``BrainPy``, our goal is to reveal the world of computational neuroscience to new learners.

Examples
=================
Here you can see some examples of using `bpmodels` to simplify networks implementation.
